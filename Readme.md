This project aims to help the city of Paris to become a smart-city, by optimizing the rounds for the maintenance of the trees of the city.

For this, the website <a href="https://opendata.paris.fr/pages/home/">opendata.paris.fr</a> provides data on the location and type of trees in the city.

The goal is to realize a first statistical analysis of the trees of the city.

> You will find the different statistical analysis of the city trees in the "/Solution/" folder.
